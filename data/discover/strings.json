  "After configuring Phabricator to process inbound mail, you can interact with objects (like tasks and revisions) over email.

You can also use **mail commands** to take a greater range of actions (like claiming a task or requesting changes to a revision) without needing to log in to the web UI.\n\nMail commands are keywords which start with an exclamation point, like `!claim`. Some commands may take parameters, like `!assign alincoln`.\n\nTo use mail commands, write one command per line at the beginning or end of your mail message. For example, you could write this in a reply to task email to claim the task:\n\n```\n!claim\n\nI'll take care of this.\n```\n\n\nWhen Phabricator receives your mail, it will process any commands first, then post the remaining message body as a comment. You can execute multiple commands at once:\n\n```\n!assign alincoln\n!close\n\nI just talked to @alincoln, and he showed me that he fixed this.\n```\n": "",

If you run Apache/mod_php this will probably be set correctly for you automatically, but if you run Phabricator as CGI/FCGI (e.g., through nginx or lighttpd), you need to configure your web server so that it passes the value correctly based on the connection type.\n\nIf you configure Phabricator in cluster mode, note that this setting is ignored by intracluster requests.": "",

  "Normally, Phabricator issues HTTP redirects after a successful POST. This can make it difficult to debug things which happen while processing the POST, because service and profiling information are lost. By setting this configuration option, Phabricator will show a page instead of automatically redirecting, allowing you to examine service and profiling information. It also makes the UX awful, so you should only enable it when debugging.": "",
  "Normally, Phabricator profiles pages only when explicitly requested via DarkConsole. However, it may be useful to profile some pages automatically.\n\nSet this option to a positive integer N to profile 1 / N pages automatically. For example, setting it to 1 will profile every page, while setting it to 1000 will profile 1 page per 1000 requests (i.e., 0.1%% of requests).\n\nSince profiling is slow and generates a lot of data, you should set this to 0 in production (to disable it) or to a large number (to collect a few samples, if you're interested in having some data to look at eventually). In development, it may be useful to set it to 1 in order to debug performance problems.\n\nNOTE: You must install XHProf for profiling to work.": "",
  "Normally, when revisions that have been \"Accepted\" are updated, they remain \"Accepted\". This allows reviewers to suggest minor alterations when accepting, and encourages authors to update if they make minor changes in response to this feedback.\n\nIf you want updates to always require re-review, you can disable the \"stickiness\" of the \"Accepted\" status with this option. This may make the process for minor changes much more burdensome to both authors and reviewers.": "",

  "Send a message about the status of a build target to Harbormaster, notifying the application of build results in an external system.\n\nSending Messages\n================\nIf you run external builds, you can use this method to publish build results back into Harbormaster after the external system finishes work or as it makes progress.\n\nThe simplest way to use this method is to call it once after the build finishes with a `pass` or `fail` message. This will record the build result, and continue the next step in the build if the build was waiting for a result.\n\nWhen you send a status message about a build target, you can optionally include detailed `lint` or `unit` results alongside the message. See below for details.\n\nIf you want to report intermediate results but a build hasn't completed yet, you can use the `work` message. This message doesn't have any direct effects, but allows you to send additional data to update the progress of the build target. The target will continue waiting for a completion message, but the UI will update to show the progress which has been made.\n\nMessage Types\n=============\nWhen you send Harbormaster a message, you must include a `type`, which describes the overall state of the build. For example, use `pass` to tell Harbormaster that a build completed successfully.\n\nSupported message types are:\n\n%s\n\nUnit Results\n============\nYou can report test results alongside a message. The simplest way to do this is to report all the results alongside a `pass` or `fail` message, but you can also send a `work` message to report intermediate results.\n\nTo provide unit test results, pass a list of results in the `unit` parameter. Each result should be a dictionary with these keys:\n\n%s\n\nThe `result` parameter recognizes these test results:\n\n%s\n\nThis is a simple, valid value for the `unit` parameter. It reports one passing test and one failing test:\n\n\n\n```lang=json\n%s```\n\nLint Results\n============\nLike unit test results, you can report lint results alongside a message. The `lint` parameter should contain results as a list of dictionaries with these keys:\n\n%s\n\nThe `severity` parameter recognizes these severity levels:\n\n%s\n\nThis is a simple, valid value for the `lint` parameter. It reports one error and one warning:\n\n```lang=json\n%s```\n\n": "",

This can prevent you from using profiling tools to understand page performance in detail.\n\nIn these cases, you can use this option to force the page to abort after a smaller number of seconds (for example, 10), and dump a useful stack trace. This can provide useful information about why a page is hanging.\n\nTo use this option, set it to a small number (like 10), and reload a hanging page.

  "When a user types their LDAP username and password into Phabricator, Phabricator can either bind to LDAP with those credentials directly (which is simpler, but not as powerful) or bind to LDAP with anonymous credentials, then search for record matching the supplied credentials (which is more complicated, but more powerful).\n\nFor many installs, direct binding is sufficient. However, you may want to search first if:\n\n  - You want users to be able to log in with either their username     or their email address.\n  - The login/username is not part of the distinguished name in     your LDAP records.\n  - You want to restrict logins to a subset of users (like only     those in certain departments).\n  - Your LDAP server is configured in some other way that prevents     direct binding from working correctly.\n\n**To bind directly**, enter the LDAP attribute corresponding to the login name into the **Search Attributes** box below. Often, this is something like `sn` or `uid`. This is the simplest configuration, but will only work if the username is part of the distinguished name, and won't let you apply complex restrictions to logins.\n\n  lang=text,name=Simple Direct Binding\n  sn\n\n**To search first**, provide an anonymous username and password below (or check the **Always Search** checkbox), then enter one or more search queries into this field, one per line. After binding, these queries will be used to identify the record associated with the login name the user typed.\n\nSearches will be tried in order until a matching record is found. Each query can be a simple attribute name (like `sn` or `mail`), which will search for a matching record, or it can be a complex query that uses the string `${login}` to represent the login name.\n\nA common simple configuration is just an attribute name, like `sn`, which will work the same way direct binding works:\n\n  lang=text,name=Simple Example\n  sn\n\nA slightly more complex configuration might let the user log in with either their login name or email address:\n\n  lang=text,name=Match Several Attributes\n  mail\n  sn\n\nIf your LDAP directory is more complex, or you want to perform sophisticated filtering, you can use more complex queries. Depending on your directory structure, this example might allow users to log in with either their email address or username, but only if they're in specific departments:\n\n  lang=text,name=Complex Example\n  (&(mail=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))\n  (&(sn=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))\n\nAll of the attribute names used here are just examples: your LDAP server may use different attribute names.": "",
