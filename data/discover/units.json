      "When a user types their LDAP username and password into Phabricator, Phabricator can either bind to LDAP with those credentials directly (which is simpler, but not as powerful) or bind to LDAP with anonymous credentials, then search for record matching the supplied credentials (which is more complicated, but more powerful).\n\nFor many installs, direct binding is sufficient. However, you may want to search first if:\n\n  - You want users to be able to log in with either their username     or their email address.\n  - The login/username is not part of the distinguished name in     your LDAP records.\n  - You want to restrict logins to a subset of users (like only     those in certain departments).\n  - Your LDAP server is configured in some other way that prevents     direct binding from working correctly.\n\n**To bind directly**, enter the LDAP attribute corresponding to the login name into the **Search Attributes** box below. Often, this is something like `sn` or `uid`. This is the simplest configuration, but will only work if the username is part of the distinguished name, and won't let you apply complex restrictions to logins.\n\n  lang=text,name=Simple Direct Binding\n  sn\n\n**To search first**, provide an anonymous username and password below (or check the **Always Search** checkbox), then enter one or more search queries into this field, one per line. After binding, these queries will be used to identify the record associated with the login name the user typed.\n\nSearches will be tried in order until a matching record is found. Each query can be a simple attribute name (like `sn` or `mail`), which will search for a matching record, or it can be a complex query that uses the string `${login}` to represent the login name.\n\nA common simple configuration is just an attribute name, like `sn`, which will work the same way direct binding works:\n\n  lang=text,name=Simple Example\n  sn\n\nA slightly more complex configuration might let the user log in with either their login name or email address:\n\n  lang=text,name=Match Several Attributes\n  mail\n  sn\n\nIf your LDAP directory is more complex, or you want to perform sophisticated filtering, you can use more complex queries. Depending on your directory structure, this example might allow users to log in with either their email address or username, but only if they're in specific departments:\n\n  lang=text,name=Complex Example\n  (&(mail=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))\n  (&(sn=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))\n\nAll of the attribute names used here are just examples: your LDAP server may use different attribute names.": "",

      "Send a message about the status of a build target to Harbormaster, notifying the application of build results in an external system.\n\nSending Messages\n================\nIf you run external builds, you can use this method to publish build results back into Harbormaster after the external system finishes work or as it makes progress.\n\nThe simplest way to use this method is to call it once after the build finishes with a `pass` or `fail` message. This will record the build result, and continue the next step in the build if the build was waiting for a result.\n\nWhen you send a status message about a build target, you can optionally include detailed `lint` or `unit` results alongside the message. See below for details.\n\nIf you want to report intermediate results but a build hasn't completed yet, you can use the `work` message. This message doesn't have any direct effects, but allows you to send additional data to update the progress of the build target. The target will continue waiting for a completion message, but the UI will update to show the progress which has been made.\n\nMessage Types\n=============\nWhen you send Harbormaster a message, you must include a `type`, which describes the overall state of the build. For example, use `pass` to tell Harbormaster that a build completed successfully.\n\nSupported message types are:\n\n%s\n\nUnit Results\n============\nYou can report test results alongside a message. The simplest way to do this is to report all the results alongside a `pass` or `fail` message, but you can also send a `work` message to report intermediate results.\n\nTo provide unit test results, pass a list of results in the `unit` parameter. Each result should be a dictionary with these keys:\n\n%s\n\nThe `result` parameter recognizes these test results:\n\n%s\n\nThis is a simple, valid value for the `unit` parameter. It reports one passing test and one failing test:\n\n\n\n```lang=json\n%s```\n\nLint Results\n============\nLike unit test results, you can report lint results alongside a message. The `lint` parameter should contain results as a list of dictionaries with these keys:\n\n%s\n\nThe `severity` parameter recognizes these severity levels:\n\n%s\n\nThis is a simple, valid value for the `lint` parameter. It reports one error and one warning:\n\n```lang=json\n%s```\n\n": "",

This may be useful if the build takes a long time to run (so you do not expect users to wait for it) or the outcome is not important.\n\nThis warning is only advisory.

      "After configuring Phabricator to process inbound mail, you can interact with objects (like tasks and revisions) over email. For information on configuring Phabricator, see **[[ %s | Configuring Inbound Email ]]**.\n\nIn most cases, you can reply to email you receive from Phabricator to leave comments. You can also use **mail commands** to take a greater range of actions (like claiming a task or requesting changes to a revision) without needing to log in to the web UI.\n\nMail commands are keywords which start with an exclamation point, like `!claim`. Some commands may take parameters, like `!assign alincoln`.\n\nTo use mail commands, write one command per line at the beginning or end of your mail message. For example, you could write this in a reply to task email to claim the task:\n\n```\n!claim\n\nI'll take care of this.\n```\n\n\nWhen Phabricator receives your mail, it will process any commands first, then post the remaining message body as a comment. You can execute multiple commands at once:\n\n```\n!assign alincoln\n!close\n\nI just talked to @alincoln, and he showed me that he fixed this.\n```\n": "配置 Phabricator 处理入站邮件后，你可以通过邮件与对象（如任务和修订）进行交互。有关配置 Phabricator 的信息，请查看 **[[ %s | Configuring Inbound Email ]]**。\n\n在大多数情况下，你可以回复从 Phabricator 收到的邮件来发表评论。你还可以使用**邮件命令**来执行更大范围的操作（例如声明任务或请求修订变更）而无需登录 Web 用户界面。\n\n邮件命令是以感叹号开始的关键字，如`!claim`。有些命令可能会携带参数，如`!assign alincoln`。\n\n要使用邮件命令，在邮件开头或结尾处每行写一个命令。例如，你可以在一个回复任务邮件里写这个来声明任务：\n\n```\n!claim\n\n我会照顾好这个。\n```\n\n\n当 Phabricator 收到你的邮件时，它将首先处理所有命令，然后将剩余的邮件正文作为评论发布。你可以一次执行多个命令：\n\n```\n!assign alincoln\n!close\n\n我刚和 @alincoln 谈过并且他给我看他修好了这个。\n```\n",
