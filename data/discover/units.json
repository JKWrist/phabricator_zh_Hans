      "When a user types their LDAP username and password into Phabricator, Phabricator can either bind to LDAP with those credentials directly (which is simpler, but not as powerful) or bind to LDAP with anonymous credentials, then search for record matching the supplied credentials (which is more complicated, but more powerful).\n\nFor many installs, direct binding is sufficient. However, you may want to search first if:\n\n  - You want users to be able to log in with either their username     or their email address.\n  - The login/username is not part of the distinguished name in     your LDAP records.\n  - You want to restrict logins to a subset of users (like only     those in certain departments).\n  - Your LDAP server is configured in some other way that prevents     direct binding from working correctly.\n\n**To bind directly**, enter the LDAP attribute corresponding to the login name into the **Search Attributes** box below. Often, this is something like `sn` or `uid`. This is the simplest configuration, but will only work if the username is part of the distinguished name, and won't let you apply complex restrictions to logins.\n\n  lang=text,name=Simple Direct Binding\n  sn\n\n**To search first**, provide an anonymous username and password below (or check the **Always Search** checkbox), then enter one or more search queries into this field, one per line. After binding, these queries will be used to identify the record associated with the login name the user typed.\n\nSearches will be tried in order until a matching record is found. Each query can be a simple attribute name (like `sn` or `mail`), which will search for a matching record, or it can be a complex query that uses the string `${login}` to represent the login name.\n\nA common simple configuration is just an attribute name, like `sn`, which will work the same way direct binding works:\n\n  lang=text,name=Simple Example\n  sn\n\nA slightly more complex configuration might let the user log in with either their login name or email address:\n\n  lang=text,name=Match Several Attributes\n  mail\n  sn\n\nIf your LDAP directory is more complex, or you want to perform sophisticated filtering, you can use more complex queries. Depending on your directory structure, this example might allow users to log in with either their email address or username, but only if they're in specific departments:\n\n  lang=text,name=Complex Example\n  (&(mail=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))\n  (&(sn=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))\n\nAll of the attribute names used here are just examples: your LDAP server may use different attribute names.": "",

      "Send a message about the status of a build target to Harbormaster, notifying the application of build results in an external system.\n\nSending Messages\n================\nIf you run external builds, you can use this method to publish build results back into Harbormaster after the external system finishes work or as it makes progress.\n\nThe simplest way to use this method is to call it once after the build finishes with a `pass` or `fail` message. This will record the build result, and continue the next step in the build if the build was waiting for a result.\n\nWhen you send a status message about a build target, you can optionally include detailed `lint` or `unit` results alongside the message. See below for details.\n\nIf you want to report intermediate results but a build hasn't completed yet, you can use the `work` message. This message doesn't have any direct effects, but allows you to send additional data to update the progress of the build target. The target will continue waiting for a completion message, but the UI will update to show the progress which has been made.\n\nMessage Types\n=============\nWhen you send Harbormaster a message, you must include a `type`, which describes the overall state of the build. For example, use `pass` to tell Harbomaster that a build completed successfully.\n\nSupported message types are:\n\n%s\n\nUnit Results\n============\nYou can report test results alongside a message. The simplest way to do this is to report all the results alongside a `pass` or `fail` message, but you can also send a `work` message to report intermediate results.\n\nTo provide unit test results, pass a list of results in the `unit` parameter. Each result shoud be a dictionary with these keys:\n\n%s\n\nThe `result` parameter recognizes these test results:\n\n%s\n\nThis is a simple, valid value for the `unit` parameter. It reports one passing test and one failing test:\n\n\n\n```lang=json\n%s```\n\nLint Results\n============\nLike unit test results, you can report lint results alongside a message. The `lint` parameter should contain results as a list of dictionaries with these keys:\n\n%s\n\nThe `severity` parameter recognizes these severity levels:\n\n%s\n\nThis is a simple, valid value for the `lint` parameter.
